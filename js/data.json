Unlike many sequels in the modern era, however, the Odyssey actually seems to be an improvement, in some respects, on the original and is quite capable of standing as an independent work. Odysseia, which has been this poem's name in Greek since Herodotus called it that in the fifth century bce, means simply the story of Odysseus. That story refers to the ten-year-long return trip of Odysseus from Troy to his island home of Ithaca, off the west coast of Greece. Because the epic pertains to this long journey, the term odyssey has since come to mean any significant and difficult journey.",

Since Catullus is generally thought to have lived between 84 and 54 B. C. E., this manuscript was a copy of a copy of a copy... going back for some 1400 years--though nothing is known about those earlier manuscripts. In fact, the text of Catullus that we use today, while it derives ultimately from this single manuscript, is based on copies, and on copies of copies, of that one, since the manuscript itself is long gone.",

                    "description": "When Roman armies conquered the remnants of Alexander's empire in 168 BCE, they also conquered the Greek city states. The Romans soon realized the uniqueness of what they had overcome. 'Captured Greece captured its fierce conqueror,' wrote the Roman poet, Horace. His point was that Romans recognized something in Greek culture that was more impressive than anything Rome itself had achieved, in spite of Rome's unprecedented military success. The result is that Roman culture adapted itself to the model of Greece, at least in art, religion, and literature. Roman statues, temples, and public buildings were rebuilt in imitation of those in Greece. Greek stories of the gods were retold with Roman names in place of Greek. Roman thinkers adapted the philosophical ideas of the Athenian academy to their situation in the Roman republic and especially in the Roman empire.",

Ovid's path to stardom paralleled that of many popular musicians, writers, and filmmakers today: he picked a genre – in his case, love poetry – and stuck to it, working at it and working at it until it was like putty in his hands. There's no question that the books Ovid wrote during this period are pretty amazing (we especially recommend the Heroides, a series of poems presented as letters from jilted mythological ladies to their deadbeat boyfriends and husbands).",

With detailed analysis of the poet’s descent into hell and navigation through its various levels, the program interprets Dante’s motives for embarking on such a journey, explains his relationship and interaction with both Virgil and Beatrice, and describes the complex mixture of morality and humanism within the work—embodied in Dante’s attitude toward those who inhabit the realms of the dead.",

Heroic Identity in the World of Beowulf resolves this tension by emphasizing Beowulf's identity as a foreign fighter seeking glory abroad. Such men resemble wreccan, 'exiles' compelled to leave their homelands due to excessive violence. Beowulf may be potentially arrogant, therefore, but he learns prudence. This native wisdom highlights a king's duty to his warband, in expectation of Beowulf's future rule. The dragon fight later raises the same question of incompatible identities, hero versus king. In frequent reference to Greek epic and Icelandic saga, this revisionist approach to Beowulf offers new interpretations of flyting rhetoric, the custom of men dying with their lord, and the poem's digressions.",

This Babylonian epic is believed to have taken its present form between approximately 1200 and 1000 B.C., but it has Sumerian roots that may stretch back an additional fifteen hundred years. Critically acclaimed as the most accomplished and engaging pre-Homeric narrative, the story tells of the deeds and adventures of a legendary hero-king and his wild-man friend, Enkidu. Historians note that there was an historical Sumerian King Gilgamesh of Uruk who lived around 2650 B.C., but it is impossible to determine to what extent the story is based on his actual exploits and where myth intervenes. The Epic of Gilgamesh is also an important resource for comparative religion scholars because its narrative of a great flood predates the account in the Bible.",

The Arabian Nights first appeared in its Arabic form around 850 AD and it has been considered a remarkable mystery in Classical Arabic Literature. Although many scholars deny its literary importance, The Arabian Nights can be viewed as a valuable source of Middle Eastern social history, being composed of the most extensive and intimate recordings of the medieval Islamic period. Generations of Arabic readers have appreciated the versatile and imaginative use of Arabic and the mixture of the classical and colloquial language in many of the stories, a style which helped diversify the characters from the narrative.",

The epic is widely known and loved in South and Southeast Asia. There it is considered first as an exciting adventure tale about a banished prince who wanders for years in the wilderness separated from his beloved wife. In this way it is comparable to the Odyssey tale of ancient Greece, which continues to entrance the Euro-American world. (India’s other great ancient epic, the Mahabharata, is a battle tale compared in turn with Homer’s Iliad.)",

This period is also said to be the beginning of Bhakti Movement in India. A weaver by profession, Kabir ranks among the world's greatest poets. Back home in India, he is perhaps the most quoted author. The Holy Guru Granth Sahib contains over 500 verses by Kabir. The Sikh community in particular and others who follow the Holy Granth, hold Kabir in the same reverence as the other ten Gurus.",

                    "description": "Mirabai (also known as Meerabai, Mira, Meera) is the most well known of the women bhakti (Hindu devotional) saints of India. According to tradition, this 16th-century royal devotee of Krishna was born in Merta in Rajasthan in the kingdom of Marwar and dedicated to Krishna from childhood, but married into the royal family of Mewar in Chittor, most say against her will. She refused to behave as a woman of her caste and class was required to do and instead fearlessly danced and sang for her Lord in the public space of the temple and kept company with holy men and people from all walks of life. The rana, the ruler of Mewar (identified variously as her husband, her father-in-law, or her brother-in-law), tried to stop her, in many accounts repeatedly trying to kill her for these transgressions. Most famously, he sent her a cup of poison in the guise of holy water, but she remained unharmed and undeterred. Ultimately, she departed to become a wandering religious leader, reportedly traveling to holy places associated with Krishna, including Vrindavan (the land of his youthful incarnation) and Dwarka (the capital of the mature Krishna’s kingdom), where she ultimately merged with his image. Though admired by devotees of many different branches of devotional Hinduism, she remains formally unaffiliated and is explicitly rejected by the followers of Vallabhacarya. If she is said to have a guru at all, she is most often associated with the untouchable leatherworker saint, Raidas (also known as Ravidas, Rohidas). She is known not only for her story but also the devotional songs of love and longing she is said to have composed. A multitude of stories have circulated about her as her fame spread across India, and an immense body of songs are attributed to her, with those that might have been composed by this individual woman inseparable from those composed by others in subsequent centuries in her name and style. She has come to inspire many, her popularity crossing the borders of caste, language, religion, culture, and time.",

David Conrad conveys the strong narrative thrust of the Sunjata epic in his presentation of substantial excerpts from his translation of a performance by Djanka Tassey Conde. Readers approaching the epic for the first time will appreciate the translation's highly readable, poetic English as well as Conrad's informative Introduction and notes. Scholars will find the familiar heroes and heroines taking on new dimensions, secondary characters gaining increased prominence, and previously unknown figures emerging from obscurity.",

The Kebra Nagast tells the legend of the Queen of Sheba's son by King Solomon, Menyelek (also known herein as Bayna-Lehkem and David II). Menyelek engineers a plot to take the Tabernacle of the Law of God (i.e., the Ark of the Covenant) to Ethiopia. This is done at the behest of an Angel of God who predicts the downfall of the kingdom of Solomon. Comitted to writing in the fourteenth century, the Kebra Nagast was derived from Ethiopian oral traditions of the Queen of Sheba and her state marriage with Solomon. The Kebra Nagast has been cited as one of the sources of the Rastafarian movement because of its support of Ethiopian theocracy. ",
